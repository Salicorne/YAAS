    \section{Confirmation form (UC3)}

    UC3 states that the user should be asked for a confirmation before creating a new auction. I implemented it using the rendering of a confirmation form, containing all auction informations in hidden field. The first auction creation form is validated server-side : if all informations are correct, the confirmation form is shown with these informations. Only when this confirmation form is submited the new auction is created and saved in database : thus if the user cancels the process or never submits the form the auction is not saved. This behaviour is described in the file \texttt{Auction/views.py}, in the functions \texttt{AuctionEditView::get}, \texttt{AuctionEditView::post} and \texttt{auctionConfirm}.
